Project Overview and Technology List
Context: This project involves developing a system to manage war game planning sessions. The system will consist of a backend server, an administrative frontend, and a client application. The primary goal is to create a robust environment where users can join and participate in game planning sessions, record their discussions, and analyze the results. The administrative interface will allow facilitators to create, manage, and review these sessions.

Communication Protocol:

GraphQL with Apollo Server: We will use Apollo Server with GraphQL as the communication protocol between the frontend and backend. This allows for efficient querying of data, ensuring that clients can request exactly what they need and nothing more.
Technologies:

Node.js
TypeScript
GraphQL (Apollo Server)
MongoDB
Mongoose
RabbitMQ
This list specifies the core technologies we will be using for this project, ensuring that all parts of the system are interconnected and can operate smoothly.
